# Title

## Introduction

- There is growing number of BIDS open datasets
- Many of those datasets have open derivatives data. For example: preprocessed data with fmriprep or quality control reports from mriqc.
- Many of those datasets and their derivatives are accessible via the openneuro platform, but some others must be accessed through different means.
- Neurobagel is tool that allows to run search on many of those datasets and return a list of participants that match a certain query across datasets. However a user interested in that specific subset of data has no easy way to access it.
- Moreover the

In the current state users are faced with the following problems.
- There is currently no monitoring of this growing open data and thus no easy way to get a regaularly upodated overview of its content.
- There is no tool to facilitate accessing a subset of the content of raw and derivatives BIDS datasets across sources.

## Methods

Create a python package facilitate creating a synthetic cohort of participants aggregated from several datasets

## Results

Limitation:
- currently restricted to datasets that are accessible via datalad

## Conclusion
